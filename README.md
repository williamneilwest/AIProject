# AIProject


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

For this project, I was given prewritten python code and was tasked with completing the code in order to acheive a functional outcome. The objective was to get the agent(pirate) to the goal(treasure), avoiding any obstacles and using the optimal path. The code to complete was the training portion of the model.

As computer scientists, the primary job is studying the way computers work and coming up with new applications for the knowledge that we have. As scientists, the best method of practice we have is the scientific method. Coming up with an idea and pseudocode for a program or hardware/software combinations is like a hypothesis. Then we write code, which is our experiments. Then we test our code against our pseudocode and expectations. In this process, our duty to the public, clients, and any other end user is to ensure the careful handling of their data and to never write, operate, or endorse code with malicious intent.
